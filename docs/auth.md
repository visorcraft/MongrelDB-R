# Authentication

The `mongreldb-server` daemon has two auth modes. The R client supports both,
and sends credentials only in the `Authorization` header.

## Bearer token (--auth-token mode)

Pass a `token` to `mongreldb_connect()`. Every request carries an
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` header:

```r
db <- mongreldb_connect("http://127.0.0.1:8453", token = "my-secret-token")
```

## HTTP Basic (--auth-users mode)

Pass a `username` and `password`. The client base64-encodes them once and
sends `Authorization: Basic <credentials>` on every request:

```r
db <- mongreldb_connect("http://127.0.0.1:8453",
  username = "admin", password = "s3cret")
```

If both are supplied, `token` takes precedence.

## No auth (default)

If neither `token` nor `username` is provided, the client sends no
`Authorization` header. This matches a daemon started without `--auth-token`
or `--auth-users`. Any local process can then read or write data, so enable
auth on any shared host.

## TLS

The daemon speaks plain HTTP and binds to `127.0.0.1` by default, so loopback
traffic stays local. For remote or multi-tenant deployments, terminate TLS in a
reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) in front of the daemon rather than exposing it
directly.

## Auth failures

A 401 or 403 from the daemon throws a `mongreldb_error` with
`$kind == "auth"`. Catch it with `tryCatch` to react:

```r
tryCatch(
  mongreldb_put(db, "orders", list(`1` = 1)),
  mongreldb_error = function(e) {
    if (e$kind == "auth") message("Not authorized: ", e$message)
  }
)
```
